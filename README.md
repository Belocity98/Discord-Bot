# Discord Bot
---
This is a general purpose Discord bot. I made this because I am stubborn and I dislike using other people's creations.
I add whatever features I please. Make an issue or PR if you want to recommend a feature.

[Command Documentation](https://github.com/TheTrain2000/Discord-Bot/wiki/Commands)

Commands can also be viewed in Discord by typing `>help`.

**Installation:**
- Download and install Python 3.6 or up.
- `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and modify for personal use.
- Once the above steps are completed, run the bot with `python bot.py`

**Configuration:**

- [Obtaining your User ID](https://github.com/TheTrain2000/Discord-Bot/wiki/Obtaining-Your-User-ID)
- More configuration tutorials to come later.
