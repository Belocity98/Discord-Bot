Discord Bot
======
This is a general purpose Discord bot. I made this because I am stubborn and I dislike using other people's creations.
I add whatever features I please. Make an issue or PR if you want to recommend a feature.

**Installation:** Download and run bot.py with Python 3.whatever.

**Usage:** Rename example_config.json to config.json and fill in your configuration details. Removing features is as simple as removing them from the startup_extensions list in bot.py.

Once you have the bot running, type >help to see a list of commands.
